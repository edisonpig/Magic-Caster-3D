<h1>A concept game when magic spells in game needs to be typed out to cast</h1>

This game was inspired while I was rewatching the famous Harry Potter series.<br> I thought, if people need a spell to cast magic in movies, why shouldn't they have one in a game?<br>
So I made this game in a 2D enviornment to test out the algorithms and if it would be fun to play as a game. (Hopefully I will be trying out in the 3D environment.)<br><br>

In the game, player needs to type in the spell code to cast certain spells (stored in an list) and fight enemies with attack and shield spells.<br>
More features will come up as I continue watching the movie series, if my brain is not a muggle one.
